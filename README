NAME
	PHPDoctor: The PHP Documentation Creator
	5.3+ Fork of Peej's Quick & Dirty PHPDoc Clone

WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL
	This fork removes compatibility for PHP versions < 5.3.0 and makes namespaces first-class citizens.
	The @package tag is degraded to a normal "tag" without any special meaning. Instead, namespaces
	are recognized automatically (no @package required) and the documentation generated accordingly.

DESCRIPTION
	PHPDoctor is a Javadoc style comment parser for PHP, written with an
	emphasis on speed and simplicity. It is designed to be as close a
	clone to Javadoc as possible.
	
REQUIREMENTS
	PHP 5.3.0+ is required.
